            <br /><br /><br /><br />Hi! I'm Garisian (Gary-sea-yen) Kana. After escaping the binds of University, I come to realize that I enjoy bathing myself nature and anything that involves penguins (You read that right, software development didn't make the cut. Like seriously, have you seen penguins? They're so cool!). I love playing sports and having road-trips across the country to see different landscapes and experience nature as a whole. That pretty much sums me up perfect.  

            <br /><br />Hereâ€™s a longer, more official-sounding version, suitable for copying and pasting: 

            <br /><br />Garisian Kana is a recent graduate from the University of Toronto St. George Campus' Computer Science program. Garisian initally entered university with the intention of learning the astrophysics and statistics involving planetary sciences. After being exposed to coding, Garisian decided to take a few basic courses so he can have a general understanding of how software systems work. Next thing you know he completely switched his degree and started specializing in Computer Science. Much of his undergraduate studies have been focused on database and operating system development as well as complex algorithm and analysis. 

            <br /><br />During his undergraduate degree Garisian has worked in the software industry in multiple occasions. He was the only candidate that was selected to work at Siemens, a multi-national German conglomerate company, for a 16-month internship. Near the end of this degree he also had the chance to work with PartsAvatar, Canada's #1 online automotive parts retailer, for 4 a 4-month internship.   

            <br /><br />Aside from academics Garisian was also very physically active; constantly volunteering at soup kitchens, being Orientation Leader multiple times, as well as playing sports whenever the opportunity arose. During his first year he was on the track and field team and later decided to dip his feet in the world of dragonboating.  

            <br /><br />Even I'm getting bored writing this. This website is more-so a collection of milestones throughout my life. After being told to create programs for 4 years, it's nice to sit back and create something solely because you enjoy it and customize it to your preference. 

            <br /><br />Every single line line of code was written by me, and if you want to learn more about how I made this website or want to borrow some ideas, feel free to check the code out on my github account. Just remember to give credit to CoolText if you plan on making the same title styles.
